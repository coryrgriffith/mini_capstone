# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# associate products with a supplier
# suppliers = Supplier.all
# products = Product.all
# products.each do |product|
#   product.supplier_id = suppliers.sample.id
#   product.save
# end

# create images in table
# 50.times do
#   image = Image.new(url: "#{Faker::Internet.url}")
#   image.save
# end

# associate images with a product
# products = Product.all
# images = Image.all
# images.each do |image|
#   image.product_id = products.sample.id
#   image.save
